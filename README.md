# Problem Description
## Background
Breast cancer is the world's most prevalent cancer with 2.3 million women diagnosed and 685,000 deaths globally in 2020. Breast cancer tumours can arise from either the ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) where it commences as an in-situ lesion with minimal risk of metasis. Over time, it may progress to surrounding breast tissue, then to nearby lymph nodes or to other organs of the body. 

Diagnosing breast cancer includes one or more of the following:
1. Ultrasound
2. Mammogram
3. MRI 
4. Biopsy

A biopsy involves sampling tissue for pathologists to examine under a microscope and provide a diagnosis.

## Rationale

Classifying the tumours accurately is critical to appropriate management, which in turn impacts patient outcomes and well-being. Needle biopsies are considered the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis however, pathologists may differ in their interpretation of the microscopic appearance of the sampled tissue. 

## Aim

The aim of this project is to use machine learning methods to classify breast cancer tumours as benign or malignant based on features from digital images of fine needle aspiration biopsies.
